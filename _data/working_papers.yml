    abstract: "Can developing countries benefit from exporting opportunities in the growing sector of tradable services, 
    given the near free information flow via the internet and wage differentials relative to developed countries? 
    Focusing on the software development industry, we analyse data from 2.55 million software projects across 5,400 
    locations, and estimate an economic geography model in which locations trade tasks. The results reveal three 
    factors limiting exports: (i) significant productivity differences within and between countries; (ii) a notable 
    decline in trade volumes with distance; (iii) sorting patterns among software developers that are suggestive of 
    brain drain."

    abstract: "We study the economic implications of regional favoritism, a form of distributive politics that 
    redistributes resources geographically within countries. Using enterprise surveys from low- and middle-income 
    countries, we document that firms located close to leadersâ€™ birthplaces grow substantially in sales and employment 
    after leaders assume office. Firms in favored areas also experience increases in sales per worker, wages, and 
    measured total factor productivity. These effects are short-lived, and operate through rising (public) demand for 
    the non-tradable sector. We calibrate a simple structural model of resource misallocation on our estimates. 
    This exercise implies that favoritism reduces output by 0.5% annually. "

    abstract: "In this paper, we study the extent to which ministers engage in regional favoritism. We are the first to 
    provide a comprehensive analysis of a larger set of the governing elite, not just focusing on the primary leader. 
    We manually collect birthplaces of this governing elite globally. Combining this information with extended nighttime 
    luminosity and novel population data over the period from 1992 to 2016, we utilize a staggered 
    difference-in-differences estimator and find that birthplaces of ministers globally emit on average roughly 9 % 
    more nightlight. This result is predominantly attributable to the African sub-sample. We find no evidence that the 
    measured effect is driven by, or induces, migration to the home regions of ministers. The size of our data set lets 
    us investigate heterogeneities along a number of dimensions: political power, ministerial portfolio, and the 
    institutional setting."
