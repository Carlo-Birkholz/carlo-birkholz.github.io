    abstract: "We study the spatial economic effects of mineral resource activity. Using geocoded data on mine
    openings and closures in Africa, we show that mining regions experience local booms while a mine
    is in operation. We then explore how mineral resources affect non-mining regions. Non-mining
    regions might be affected by mining activity due to deliberate government policies (e. g., regional
    redistribution) or due to various inadvertent country-level macroeconomic adjustments (e. g., Dutch
    Disease - type effects or decline in institutional quality). Our results suggest that mineral resources
    have heterogeneous effects on non-mining regions. Politically important regions such as capitals
    and leaders’ birth regions benefit economically while generic non-mining regions are, in general,
    worse off from mineral resource activity. Exploring mechanisms, we find that these spatial patterns
    emerge both due to deliberate government policies as well as Dutch-Disease-style macroeconomic
    adjustments that harm regions specializing in sectors other than mining."

    abstract: "We study the economic implications of regional favoritism, a form of distributive politics that 
    redistributes resources geographically within countries. Using enterprise surveys from low- and middle-income 
    countries, we document that firms located close to leaders’ birthplaces grow substantially in sales and employment 
    after leaders assume office. Firms in favored areas also experience increases in sales per worker, wages, and 
    measured total factor productivity. These effects are short-lived, and operate through rising (public) demand for 
    the non-tradable sector. We calibrate a simple structural model of resource misallocation on our estimates. 
    This exercise implies that favoritism reduces output by 0.5% annually. "

    abstract: "In this paper, we study the extent to which ministers engage in regional favoritism. We are the first to 
    provide a comprehensive analysis of a larger set of the governing elite, not just focusing on the primary leader. 
    We manually collect birthplaces of this governing elite globally. Combining this information with extended nighttime 
    luminosity and novel population data over the period from 1992 to 2016, we utilize a staggered 
    difference-in-differences estimator and find that birthplaces of ministers globally emit on average roughly 9 % 
    more nightlight. This result is predominantly attributable to the African sub-sample. We find no evidence that the 
    measured effect is driven by, or induces, migration to the home regions of ministers. The size of our data set lets 
    us investigate heterogeneities along a number of dimensions: political power, ministerial portfolio, and the 
    institutional setting."
