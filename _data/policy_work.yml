    abstract: "In the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, about 30 percent of all EU budgetary resources 
    are allocated to cohesion. Additional amounts are made available to the European budget by Next Generation EU (NGEU) 
    through REACT EU. The central goal of EU cohesion policy remains regional convergence. However, despite the 
    substantial use of funds, convergence success is not assured. While there have been successes in East-West 
    convergence, North-South divergence persists stubbornly. Against the background of these developments and 
    methodological advances in the evaluation of EU regional policy, this project addresses, among others, the 
    following questions: How is the \"European added value\" of an EU regional policy programme to be conceptually 
    defined? How should the design and effectiveness of central rules of EU cohesion policy be assessed? What 
    adjustments to the regional policy toolbox are necessary in terms of scope, instruments and rules?"

    abstract: "The Corona pandemic continues to have a major impact on social and economic activities in Europe at the 
    end of 2021. Measures against the spread of the virus, such as lockdowns and short-time work, pose challenges to 
    public finances in many countries due to the interplay of reduced tax revenues and higher government spending. To 
    provide European countries with liquidity, the European Central Bank has therefore been buying government bonds in 
    enormous volumes since 12 March 2020 as part of the specially launched Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).
     The ceiling of 750 billion euros envisaged at the beginning has long been exceeded and since has been raised twice, 
     to now 1,850 billion euros. With this order of magnitude, the PEPP occupies a firm place in terms of importance 
     alongside the Public Sector Purchase Program, the ECB's other extensive bond-buying programme. Since the ECB 
     reserves the right under the PEPP to deviate from the ECB capital key when distributing bond purchases among the 
     euro states, the already existing question about the significance of the ECB for public debt financing in the euro 
     area is intensified.   Against this background, the aim of this research project is to present the development of 
     bond purchases within the PEPP and PSPP, to trace the significance for individual euro countries and to analyse 
     correlations with the ECB capital key and other parameters. The results are central to an assessment of the role of 
     the ECB in the sovereign debt financing of European countries, as well as the long-term functioning and cohesion 
     in the EU."
