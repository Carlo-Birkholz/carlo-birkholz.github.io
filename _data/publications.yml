    abstract: "We study the spatial economic effects of mineral resource activity. Using geocoded data on mine
    openings and closures in Africa, we show that mining regions experience local booms while a mine
    is in operation. We then explore how mineral resources affect non-mining regions. Non-mining
    regions might be affected by mining activity due to deliberate government policies (e. g., regional
    redistribution) or due to various inadvertent country-level macroeconomic adjustments (e. g., Dutch
    Disease - type effects or decline in institutional quality). Our results suggest that mineral resources
    have heterogeneous effects on non-mining regions. Politically important regions such as capitals
    and leadersâ€™ birth regions benefit economically while generic non-mining regions are, in general,
    worse off from mineral resource activity. Exploring mechanisms, we find that these spatial patterns
    emerge both due to deliberate government policies as well as Dutch-Disease-style macroeconomic
    adjustments that harm regions specializing in sectors other than mining."

    abstract: "Ramadan has attracted negative publicity and criticism in Western countries with large Muslim immigrant 
    populations. Are these attitudes justified? Does the behavior of Muslim immigrants negatively affect host 
    populations during this period? This paper investigates one important dimension of immigrant behavior that is a 
    source of concern: criminal activity. Using the universe of criminal offenses registered by the Swiss police 
    authorities, the paper documents that during Ramadan, crimes committed by Muslim migrants decline by 11%. The 
    mechanism behind this reduction most consistent with the empirical results, is one of changes in beliefs and values 
    of immigrants. Other explanations, such as time spent on community events and declining physical ability play only 
    a minor role."
