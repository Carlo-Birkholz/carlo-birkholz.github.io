    abstract: "Independent and high-quality evaluations of government policies are an important input for designing 
    evidence-based policy. Institutional frictions and lack of incentives to write such evaluations, on the other 
    hand, carry the risk of turning the system into a costly beauty contest. We study one of the most advanced markets 
    of policy evaluations in the world, the evaluations of EU Cohesion Policy interventions by the EU Member States. 
    We use a large language model to quantify the findings of about 2,300 evaluations, and complement this data with 
    our own survey of the evaluation authors. We show that the findings of evaluations are inconsistent with those of 
    the academic literature on the output impacts of Cohesion Policy. Using further variation across Member States, 
    our analysis suggests that the market of evaluations is rather oligopolistic within Member States, that it is very 
    fragmented across the EU, and that there is often a strong involvement of managing authorities in the work of 
    formally independent evaluators. These factors contribute to making the findings of the evaluations overly 
    optimistic (beautiful) risking their relevance for (evidence-based) policy. We conclude by discussing reform 
    options to make the evaluations of EU Cohesion Policy more unbiased and effective."

    abstract: "We study the spatial economic effects of mineral resource activity. Using geocoded data on mine
    openings and closures in Africa, we show that mining regions experience local booms while a mine
    is in operation. We then explore how mineral resources affect non-mining regions. Non-mining
    regions might be affected by mining activity due to deliberate government policies (e. g., regional
    redistribution) or due to various inadvertent country-level macroeconomic adjustments (e. g., Dutch
    Disease - type effects or decline in institutional quality). Our results suggest that mineral resources
    have heterogeneous effects on non-mining regions. Politically important regions such as capitals
    and leadersâ€™ birth regions benefit economically while generic non-mining regions are, in general,
    worse off from mineral resource activity. Exploring mechanisms, we find that these spatial patterns
    emerge both due to deliberate government policies as well as Dutch-Disease-style macroeconomic
    adjustments that harm regions specializing in sectors other than mining."

    abstract: "Ramadan has attracted negative publicity and criticism in Western countries with large Muslim immigrant 
    populations. Are these attitudes justified? Does the behavior of Muslim immigrants negatively affect host 
    populations during this period? This paper investigates one important dimension of immigrant behavior that is a 
    source of concern: criminal activity. Using the universe of criminal offenses registered by the Swiss police 
    authorities, the paper documents that during Ramadan, crimes committed by Muslim migrants decline by 11%. The 
    mechanism behind this reduction most consistent with the empirical results, is one of changes in beliefs and values 
    of immigrants. Other explanations, such as time spent on community events and declining physical ability play only 
    a minor role."
