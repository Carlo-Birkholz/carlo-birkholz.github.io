    abstract: "Ramadan has attracted negative publicity and criticism in Western countries with large Muslim immigrant 
    populations. Are these attitudes justified? Does the behavior of Muslim immigrants negatively affect host 
    populations during this period? This paper investigates one important dimension of immigrant behavior that is a 
    source of concern: criminal activity. Using the universe of criminal offenses registered by the Swiss police 
    authorities, the paper documents that during Ramadan, crimes committed by Muslim migrants decline by 11%. The 
    mechanism behind this reduction most consistent with the empirical results, is one of changes in beliefs and values 
    of immigrants. Other explanations, such as time spent on community events and declining physical ability play only 
    a minor role."
