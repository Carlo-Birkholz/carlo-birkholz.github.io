## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify">I am a researcher at the <a href="https://www.zew.de/en/research-at-zew/corporate-taxation-and-public-finance">Department of Public Finance and Corporate Taxation</a>
at the <a href="https://www.zew.de/en/">ZEW - Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research </a> in Mannheim, Germany, and a 4th year 
Ph.D. student at the University of Mannheim. I am also an external affiliate of the <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/nocet/" >Norwegian Centre for Taxation (NoCeT)</a>.
<br/><br/>
My general research interests are in the fields of <em>Development Economics</em>, <em>Political Economy</em>, and <em>Public Finance</em>. 
In particular I enjoy bringing large-scale, innovative data sources such as satellite imagery, household electricity consumption from smart meters, or 
web-scraped data to study economic behaviour otherwise difficult to observe. </div>
