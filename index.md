## About Me

<div style="text-align: justify">I am Assistant Professor (non-tenure track) at the <a href="https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/696774.html" target="_blank">Chair of Development Economics and Global Political Economy</a>
at the University of Göttingen, Germany. 
I am also Junior Research Associate at <a href="https://www.zew.de/en/team/cmb" target="_blank">ZEW Mannheim</a>, 
<a href="https://www.joachim-herz-stiftung.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/Projekte/Wirtschaft/202408_Add-on_fellows_de.pdf" target="_blank">Joachim-Herz Add-on Fellow</a> 
for Interdisciplinary Economics and Interdisciplinary Business Administration, and 
an external affiliate of the <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/nocet/" target="_blank">Norwegian Centre for Taxation (NoCeT)</a>.
I have received my Ph.D. from the University of Mannheim.
<br/><br/> 
My general research interests are in the fields of <em>Development Economics</em>, <em>Political Economy</em>, and <em>Public Finance</em>. 
In particular, I enjoy bringing together innovative data sources such as satellite imagery, household electricity consumption from smart meters, or 
web-scraped data, with machine learning techniques like random forests and large language models to answer economic questions otherwise difficult to study. </div>
